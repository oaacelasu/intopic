/// Router keeps parameters in global map. It means that if you create route

///  override organization id. So use :oid and :did instead of :id
/// Also router does not provide option to set regex for parameters.
/// If you put - example/:eid before - example/create for route - example/create
/// will be called route - example/:eid
